The HTML structures the website into a navigation bar, a header section, and content sections like "About Us" and "Contact Us."
The navigation bar links to key sections, providing easy access to different parts of the page.
The header section welcomes users with a bold, bouncy title, pricing information, and fun animated animal images (giraffe and elephant).
CSS animations like @keyframes bounce add dynamic movement to the animals and title for an engaging experience.
A transparent background image in the header combines a semi-opaque .png and gradient for a visually appealing design.
The "About Us" section features a video to engage users with interactive, multimedia content.
Bright, fun color schemes (e.g., coral and green) and playful fonts create a child-friendly vibe.
JavaScript introduces a delay for header content animations, enhancing the page's loading flow.
Hover effects on navigation links and buttons make interactions dynamic and visually responsive.
The overall design focuses on interactivity, animations, and aesthetics to appeal to a youthful audience.
